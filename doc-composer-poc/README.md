# Document Composer POC - Claude Code & Skills Integration

## Overview
This proof of concept demonstrates how Claude Code with custom skills can be used to compose professional Word documents by:
1. Reading a simple markdown manifest file
2. Gathering specified document pages from a library
3. Merging them with a master template
4. Preserving all formatting from source documents

## Architecture

```

## How It Works

### 1. User Creates a Manifest (markdown file)
Simple markdown file listing which documents to include:

```markdown
# Quarterly Report Q4 2024

- cover-page
- executive-summary
- financial-overview
- risk-assessment
- conclusion
```

### 2. Claude Code Processes the Request
When user asks: "Generate the quarterly report using the Q4 manifest"

Claude Code:
1. Reads the doc-composer skill
2. Parses the manifest file
3. Locates each document in the library
4. Merges them with the master template
5. Preserves all formatting, styles, headers/footers
6. Outputs the final composed document

### 3. Key Features Demonstrated
- **Format Preservation**: All styles, formatting, headers, footers maintained
- **Modular Composition**: Easy to add/remove/reorder sections
- **Template Reuse**: One-page documents can be mixed and matched
- **Professional Output**: Maintains corporate branding and formatting standards

## Benefits for Leadership

1. **Consistency**: All reports follow corporate standards automatically
2. **Efficiency**: Reports that took hours now take minutes
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize reports for different audiences
4. **Version Control**: Library documents can be updated centrally
5. **Quality**: Reduces errors from manual copy-paste operations
6. **Scalability**: Can be extended to any document type

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Library Management**: Build web interface for managing document library
2. **Advanced Templates**: Support for dynamic content insertion
3. **Approval Workflows**: Integration with document review systems
4. **Analytics**: Track which sections are used most frequently
5. **Multi-format**: Extend to PowerPoint, PDF, etc.
